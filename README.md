# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page solution

This is a solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). 


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- I learned list styling, this is the first time i do this.
- Also, while i was looking for help in list styling i got to know margin/padding-inline and margin/padding-block, which is a good shortcut for left and right/ top and bottom.

### Continued development

Padding and margins, I'm sure there is another way to make the distance between the element exactly like the sample design, 
I will keep look for it until I find a shortcut to it.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBxm7SH7pzM&list=PLDoPjvoNmBAycLCqZ6Fx-FT96cRRuPiBh&index=1) 
- [Example resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PLWdp3tC64&list=PLDoPjvoNmBAycLCqZ6Fx-FT96cRRuPiBh&index=3) - This is an amazing channel which has alot of concepts explained very well. I'd recommend it to any beginner, These two links helped me in styling the lists in this project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
